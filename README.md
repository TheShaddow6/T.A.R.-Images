# T.A.R.-Total-Automation-Recipes-
T.A.R. is a Satisfactory Mod which adds new Alternate Recipes allowing you to automate things that you normally couldn't.  Berries? Automated! Biomass? Automated! Total Automation!

*Russian Accent*

We at Korolev Inc. are proud to present to you the D.S.D.™.
It is a simple Digital Storage Device that contains information for advanced alternate Recipes.
We managed to hack the milestone system of Ficsit Inc. and add the Blueprint for the D.S.D.™ in the 8th tier.
All you have to do is decode the data on them in the MAM.
The recipes you unlock can be for Items you already know, but also for new and exciting Items.
I don’t know anything about them and have no permission to inform you about them, but maybe you have already seen some of them on the Satisfactory and Satisfactory Modding Discord.
And if you had enough of Ficsit, come and join us on Fortuna III.
